Very good movie!
D&W is such a fun & wonderful time at the movies. I was smiling and laughing throughout; while also amazed at the violence & action present on screen. They still find new ways for Deadpool & Wolverine to do what they do best. Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman deliver (as always) fantastic performances; Jackman brings the gravitas and Reynolds brings the laughs with a surprising amount of heart!
