Very good movie!

D&W is such a fun & wonderful time at the movies. I was smiling and laughing throughout; while also amazed at the violence & action present on screen. They still find new ways for Deadpool & Wolverine to do what they do best. Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman deliver (as always) fantastic performances; Jackman brings the gravitas and Reynolds brings the laughs with a surprising amount of heart!

The film is fine — an artisanal horror made with care and invention. But... what sticks is the Gothic high style: queasy lamplight, small coffins, imperious doctors. All good things in context — but side plates in need of a dripping, rare main course.

"Dragon Ball Super: Broly" is a breath of fresh air for Dragon Ball fans, especially those who felt Broly’s past incarnations were a bit one-dimensional. This time around, Broly is given a real backstory—he’s no longer just a mindless rage machine.

The action is absolutely insane. The final battle between Goku, Vegeta, and Broly is a visual spectacle. The animation quality is top-tier, mixing 2D and CGI seamlessly, making every punch, blast, and transformation feel bigger and more intense.

Not only that, we get to see Gogeta again, which is pretty awesome!
